# Clueless-Recreated

A project powered by the Raspberry Pi and inspired by the movie “Clueless,” in which the main character uses a computer program to select her outfit. Our project allows the user to take a photo of a shirt/pant they want to wear. Then, using machine learning, it recognises the article of clothing then parses through the user’s closet database and outputs the top ten matching shirts/pants.
